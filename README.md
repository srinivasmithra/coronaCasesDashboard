# Corona Cases Dashboard

I developed a dashboard of corona cases allover the world using HTML,CSS and JS. It's is pretty simple and designed myself when I entered into the software technology world.

It's the complete UI code written in HTML and CSS. Also used free API for corona cases data.

Few Data Sources are 
1. https://covidtracking.com/data/api
2. https://postman-toolboxes.github.io/covid-19/#featured-collections
3. https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange/68ef9520-24e9-4cf2-b2f5-620025690913/covid19-data-tracking-api/

Latest Update:
NOTE:: Updated the code because of trouble from the free source API used , so that only UI code is available here.
